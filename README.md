# schoolPlanner
 
This is an application that will allow people in CT Region 15 - specifically PHS - to keep track of the days of the week and what classes they have.

Eventually I may expand it to create a more inclusive project, but for now I'm only going to keep it at this school system.

## Plans

As of right now, I'm working on the ability to add classes to days.
We have a weird schedule and I have to account for that.
This means that days are going to have classes, and that will be it for now - just a basic calendar.

At some point, the ability to add the assignments that you have for homework will be added, but a basic framework is essential first.
